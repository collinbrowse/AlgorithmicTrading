# AlgorithmicTrading

UChicago's annual Midwest Trading Competition poses small teams of undergraduate students against each other to craft and code complex financial trading algorithms for optimal market performance in three different simulated market scenarios. This competition tested team's critical thinking, problem solving, communication, teamwork, mathematical, financial and programming skills. 

Using Java and Options City's Freeway platform I helped construct algorithms for three different financial situations where I was the sole developer for cases 1 and 2. 

Our code was managed through Bitbucket and my team and I competed against 17 prestigious schools and over 100 students. 

While St. Lawrence didn't shock the leaderboards, we did win Case 2 Round 3. The problems and situations that we faced were the first time anyone from our team had ever encountered problems like this. We had no experience from class like many of the other universities had. Creating the algorithms were much harder than we had expected but in the end we had a blast doing it, we were exposed to a whole new industry and we learned a lot in a short amount of time. It is clear that from Case 1 to Case 2 the quality of my code dramatically increased, in just a 2 week time.
